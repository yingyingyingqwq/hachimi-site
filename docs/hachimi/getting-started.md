## Install Guides

Hachmi Edge has an installer for both Windows and Android. They are quite different!  
Please see the specific guides and continue with the rest of this page after installing.

[For Windows](installing-windows)  
[For Android](installing-android)

## First Time Setup

Upon launching the game for the first time after installing Hachimi Edge, you should be greeted with this dialog:

![First Time Setup](/assets/first-time-setup.jpg)

::: details I don't see it!
**If you are migrating to Edge**:  
You likely didn't uninstall first. This can leave outdated values in your configuration. Open this setup from the Hachimi Edge menu and make sure the Meta URL is `https://gitlab.com/umatl/hachimi-meta/-/raw/main/meta.json` (Unless you are **knowingly** using a different one). Not doing so will result in outdated translations and corrupted texture issues.

**Otherwise**:  
Hachimi Edge was not installed correctly. Please read the install guide carefully and try again, or look at [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting).
:::

Tap on Next and choose your preferred translation source, then tap on Done to save your configuration and start the update check.

If selected, Hachimi Edge will now prompt you to download a new translation update, click on Yes to start downloading the files.

You can return to this dialog later to change your translation source through the Hachimi menu.

::: tip
If you have any issues with translations, you can disable them in Config Editor > Gameplay, then restart the game.
:::

## Using

Configuration is done using an [in-game menu](built-in-gui) or through the [raw config file](config).  
Hachimi Edge also supports [Plugins](/docs/plugins/about).
